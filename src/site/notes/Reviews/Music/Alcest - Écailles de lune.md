# Songs
## Écailles de lune, Pt. 1
Écailles de lune opens with the first part of its title track. My highlight is definitely the guitar line starting around 3:30 but the whole song sets up to an incredibly strong start and contains enough variety to make the song not feel too long even if its almost 10 minutes long. If theres something i'm missing here, it's more usage of water sounds towards the end (and maybe also the beginning?) to make it feel more connected to Écailles de lune, Pt. 2 and in general have some harsh vocals on this too. But thats just nitpicking honestly.

## Écailles de lune, Pt. 2
Part 2 of the title track is tied with the closer for my favorite song. The atmosphere is again very nutty, as to be expected from Alcest and we hear Neige scream for the first time on this album. My favorite part is again around the 3:10 mark as i really like the distorted guitars leading into harsh vocals, followed by choir vocals around 4:08. The ending feels a bit long though and calms down a lot from the earlier aggression. Really wish Alcest used something like that choir in more of their songs, it really sounds great and fits their style.

## Percées de lumière
This track is again picking up the heavyness of the first part of Écailles de lune, Pt.2 and while i think they made similar songs (especially in structure) to this one that i like more on later albums like Là où naissent les couleurs nouvelles and L'île des morts, its still a banger. My nitpick for this song is that the repeating melody can get a bit repetitive but maybe i also heard it too much at this point. Probably the heaviest song on the album.

## Abysses
Ok interlude that fits the nocturnal and aquatic vibe they wanted well but nothing special and skippable.

## Solar Song
On Solar Song, we're getting into clean vocals again with a more dreamy mood than the previous tracks. While i do still enjoy it, its my least favorite "real" song on this album. Just doesn't really hit as hard as the others for me.

## Sur l'océan couleur de fer
This was actually the first song i heard from Écailles de lune and it hit me hard from the beginning. Very different from the other songs as it is a very calm and moody guitar piece, this goes very hard when lying in bed in complete darkness. In terms of atmosphere very likely to be Alcests best song and Neige nails it on vocals. Just wish there were more songs like this.
