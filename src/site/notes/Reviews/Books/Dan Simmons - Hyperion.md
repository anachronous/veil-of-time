Similar to the Canterbury Tales which is a collection of short stories of pilgrims taking a pilgrimage from London to Canterbury, Hyperion consists of 6 short stories that form the meat of the book. They are then connected by an overarching narrative in the present (or well future, since this is a science fiction novel) that follows a group of pilgrims on a pilgrimage to the so-called time tombs which is guarded by what is only known as the Shrike. Humanity in this age has settled planets in the hundreds that are all connected by portals (called farcasters). The two other important galactic players are the Ousters and the TechnoCore and since i forgot exactly how they are introduced, i wont elaborate further.

| Short Story          | Review                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| The Priest's Tale    | A catholic priest researches an isolated civilisation, written as a diary. I'd very much call this one a horror story and an incredibly strong start to the book. Probably my favorite out of all of them.                            |
| The Soldier's Tale   | Much more action focused, this one is about a soldier and his mysterious lover. We also learn much more about the Shrike here. Not too big on this one but its also not bad.                                                          |
| The Poet's Tale      | This story is about a poet who used to live on old earth and then got away on what is essentially a slave ship. He later wrote a series called "Dying Earth" (which is probably a Jack Vance reference?) that got incredibly popular. |
| The Scholar's Tale   | This is about a jewish professor trying to find a cure for his daughters illness which causes her to age backwards. Very strong story, either tied with the priests tale or my second favorite for me.                                |
| The Detective's Tale | A story told by a private investigator falling in love with a cybrid (basically a cyborg from how i understood it). Has some of the biggest twists/revelations in the book so i wont say anything more.                               |
| The Consul's Tale    | This one is about a backwater planet about to be connected to the farcaster system and the threat of it being overran by tourists. Additionally the implications of time dilatation on relationships are explored. Also very good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

# Conclusion
While not every story hit me quite as hard as the priest's tale or the scholar's tale, it's still a very good start to one of my favorite science fiction series. My main problem is the ending which is kind of a cliffhanger. Personally not all too salty though, as i like the second book (The Fall of Hyperion) even more. I'm giving this a **4.5/5**.
